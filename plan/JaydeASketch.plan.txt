Jayde-A-Sketch (Jayde's version of an Etch-A-Sketch)

The idea for this is to use mouse and arrow-key input to drag the "cursor" around on
a white (or gray) board to draw pictures.  Like an actual Etch-a-Sketch, the point
of drawing never leaves the surface, so everything is a continuous line.

A shake of the board will erase it, and we start over.

And also like an actual Etch-a-Sketch, the point of drawing doesn't change when we
shake it, so if we want to start in a specific spot, we have to go there and
then shake the board to clear it.

This is idea for what I want to work on - updating a BufferedImage object to display
"realtime".

We'll  use 2 mouse buttons now - left mouse button to drag the cursor (just moving
the mouse will get frustrating, so let us at least make it a conscious decision), and
right mouse button will pan the image around (with alt for Fine control, Shift for
Axis lock and Ctrl for snap to grid behavior).  Arrow keys to move the cursor or the
board (arrow moves cursor, Ctrl-arrow moves the board)

If one button is already held down, ignore the other button press (first button
held takes priority and will lock out any other button presses until it is released).

For Shift (Axis Lock), we'll make a new LMB origin at the point where the user
presses Shift, and we'll stop locking when they release, they can make a jagged line
with straight sections if they want by repeatedly holding and releasing shift while
they drag with LMB.
